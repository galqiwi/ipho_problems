  <li>&#9;A cathode ray tube (CRT), consisting of an electron gun and a screen, 
    is placed within a uniform constant magnetic field of magnitude <B>B</B> such 
    that the magnetic field is parallel to the beam axis of the gun, as shown 
    in figure 2.1.&#9;<br>

    <p>&#9;The electron beam emerges from the anode of the electron gun on the 
      axis, but with a divergence of up to 5<FONT FACE="Symbol">°</FONT> from 
      the axis, as illustrated in figure 2.2. In general a diffuse spot is produced 
      on the screen, but for certain values of the magnetic field a sharply focused 
      spot is obtained.<br>

      to the axis as it leaves the electron gun, and considering the components 
      of its motion parallel and perpendicular to the axis, derive an expression 
      for the charge to mass ratio e/m for the electron in terms of the following 
      quantities: </p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>&#9;&#9;the smallest magnetic field for which a focused spot is obtained,<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>&#9;&#9;the accelerating potential difference across the electron gun 
        <I>V</I> &nbsp;&nbsp;(note that <I>V</I> &lt; 2 kV),<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>&#9;&#9;<I>D</I>, the distance between the anode and the screen. </li>

  <li>Consider another method of evaluating the charge to mass ratio of the electron. 
    The arrangement is shown from a side view and in plan view (from above) in 
    figure 2.3, with the direction of the magnetic field marked <B>B</B>. Within 
    this uniform magnetic field <B>B</B> are placed two brass circular plates 
    of radius <FONT FACE="Symbol">r</FONT> which are separated by a very small 
    distance <I>t</I>. A potential difference <I>V</I> is maintained between them. 
    The plates are mutually parallel and co-axial, however their axis is perpendicular 
    to the magnetic field. A photographic film, covers the inside of the curved 
    surface of a cylinder of radius <FONT FACE="Symbol">r</FONT> + <I>s</I>, which 
    is held co-axial with the plates. In other words, the film is at a radial 
    distance <I>s</I> from the edges of the plates. The entire arrangement is 
    placed <I>in vacuo</I>. Note that <I>t</I> is very much smaller than both 
    <I>s</I> and <I><FONT FACE="Symbol">r</font></I>.</li>
