<h2>Part A</h2>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;A bungee jumper is attached to one end of a long elastic 
  rope. The other end of the elastic rope is fixed to a high bridge. The jumper 
  steps off the bridge and falls, from rest, towards the river below. He does 
  not hit the water. The mass of the jumper is <I>m</I>, the unstretched length 
  of the rope is <I>L</I>, the rope has a force constant (force to produce 1 m 
  extension) of <I>k</I> and the gravitational field strength is <I>g</I>. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P>You may assume that </P>

<UL>
<LI>the jumper can be regarded as a point mass <I>m</I> attached to the end of the rope,</LI>
<LI>the mass of the rope is negligible compared to <I>m</I>, </LI>
<LI>the rope obeys Hooke’s law, </LI>
<LI>air resistance can be ignored throughout the fall of the jumper.</LI></UL>

Obtain expressions for the following and insert on the answer sheet:
<ul>
  <li>the distance <I>y</I> dropped by the jumper before coming instantaneously 
    to rest for the first time, </li>
  <li>the maximum speed <I><FONT FACE="Symbol">u</font></I> attained by the jumper 
    during this drop,</li>
  <li>the time <I>t</I> taken during the drop before coming to rest for the first 
    time. </li>

<h2>&#9;Part B</h2>
<P>A heat engine operates between two identical bodies at different temperatures 
  <I>T</I><SUB>&nbsp;A</SUB> and <I>T&nbsp;</I><SUB>B </SUB>(<I>T&nbsp;</I><SUB>A</SUB> 
  <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#62;</FONT> <I>T</I><SUB>&nbsp;B</SUB>), with each body 
  having mass <I>m</I> and constant specific heat capacity <I>s</I>. The bodies 
  remain at constant pressure and undergo no change of phase.</P>

<ol>
  <li>&#9;Showing full working, obtain an expression for the final temperature 
    <I>T</I><SUB>&nbsp;0 </SUB>attained by the two bodies<SUB> </SUB>A and B if 
    the heat engine extracts from the system the maximum amount of mechanical 
    work that is theoretically possible. </li>

  <p>Write your expression for the final temperature <I>T</I><SUB>&nbsp;0 </SUB>on 
    the answer sheet.</p>

<ol start="2">
  <li>Hence, obtain and write on the answer sheet an expression for this maximum 
    amount of work available. 
    <p>The heat engine operates between two tanks of water each of volume 2.50 
      m<SUP>3</SUP>. One tank is at 350 K and the other is at 300 K. </p>

  <li>Calculate the maximum amount of mechanical energy obtainable. Insert the 
    value on the answer sheet.

<h2>Part C</h2>
<P>&#9;It is assumed that when the earth was formed the isotopes <IMG SRC="Image5.gif" WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=21>and 
  <IMG SRC="Image6.gif" WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=21>were present but not 
  their decay products. The decays of <IMG SRC="Image7.gif" WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=21>and 
  <IMG SRC="Image8.gif" WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=21>are used to establish 
  the age of the earth, <I>T</I>.</P>

<ol TYPE="a">
  <LI>The isotope <IMG SRC="Image5.gif" WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=21>decays 
    with a half-life of 4.50 <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#180;</FONT> 10<SUP>9 </SUP>years. 
    The decay products in the resulting radioactive series have half-lives short 
    compared to this; to a first approximation their existence can be ignored. 
    The decay series terminates in the stable lead isotope <IMG SRC="Image9.gif" WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=21> 
    <p>&#9;Obtain and insert on the answer sheet an expression for the number 
      of <IMG SRC="Image10.gif" WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=21>atoms, denoted 
      <IMG SRC="Image11.gif" WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=19>, produced by radioactive 
      decay with time t, in terms of the present number of <IMG SRC="Image5.gif" WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=21> 
      atoms, denoted <IMG SRC="Image12.gif" WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=21>, 
      and the half- life time of <IMG SRC="Image5.gif" WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=21>. 
      (You may find it helpful to work in units of 10<SUP>9 </SUP>years.)</p>
</ol>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<ol type="a" start="2">
  <li>&#9;Similarly, <IMG SRC="Image13.gif" WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=21> 
    decays with a half-life of 0.710 <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#180;</FONT> 10<SUP>9 
    </SUP>years through a series of shorter half-life products to give the stable 
    isotope <IMG SRC="Image14.gif" WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=21>. 
    <p>Write down on the answer sheet an equation relating <IMG SRC="Image15.gif" WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=19> 
      to <IMG SRC="Image16.gif" WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=21>and the half-life 
      of <IMG SRC="Image13.gif" WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=21>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>A uranium ore, mixed with a lead ore, is analysed with a mass spectrometer. 
    The relative concentrations of the three lead isotopes <IMG SRC="Image17.gif" WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=21>, 
    <IMG SRC="Image10.gif" WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=21> and <IMG SRC="Image18.gif" WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=21>are 
    measured and the number of atoms are found to be in the ratios 1.00&nbsp;:&nbsp;29.6&nbsp;:&nbsp;22.6 
    respectively. The isotope <IMG SRC="Image17.gif" WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=21> 
    is used for reference as it is <U>not</U> of radioactive origin. Analysing 
    a pure lead ore gives ratios of 1.00&nbsp;:&nbsp;17.9&nbsp;:&nbsp;15.5. 
    <p>Given that the ratio <IMG SRC="Image12.gif" WIDTH=34 HEIGHT=21>: 
      <IMG SRC="Image16.gif" WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=21> is 137 :&nbsp;1, 
      derive and insert on the answer sheet an equation involving <I>T</I>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>&#9;Assume that <I>T </I>is much greater than the half lives of both uranium 
    isotopes and hence obtain an approximate value for <I>T</I>.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>This approximate value is clearly not significantly greater than the longer 
    half life, but can be used to obtain a much more accurate value for <I>T</I>. 
    <br>
    Hence, or otherwise, estimate a value for the age of the earth correct to 
    within 2%.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Part D</h2>
<P>&#9;Charge <I>Q</I> &nbsp;is uniformly distributed <I>in vacuo</I> throughout 
  a spherical volume of radius <I>R</I>. </P>

<ol type="a">
  <li>&#9;Derive expressions for the electric field strength at distance <I>r</I> 
    from the centre of the sphere for <I>r</I> <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#163;</FONT> 
    <I>R</I> and <I>r</I> <FONT FACE="Symbol">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#62;</FONT> 
    <I>R</I>.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Obtain an expression for the total electric energy associated with this 
    distribution of charge.</li>
</ol>
<P>Insert your answers to (a) and (b) on the answer sheet.</P>

<h2>Part E</h2>
<P>&#9;A circular ring of thin copper wire is set rotating about a vertical diameter 
  at a point within the Earth’s magnetic field. The magnetic flux density of the 
  Earth’s magnetic field at this point is 44.5 <FONT FACE="Symbol">m</FONT>T directed 
  at an angle of 64<SUP>o </SUP>below the horizontal. Given that the density of 
  copper is 8.90 <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#180;</FONT> 10<SUP>3</SUP> kg m<SUP>-3 
  </SUP>and its resistivity is 1.70 <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#180;</FONT> 10<SUP>-8</SUP> 
  <FONT FACE="Symbol">W</FONT> m, calculate how long it will take for the angular 
  velocity of the ring to halve. Show the steps of your working and insert the 
  value of the time on the answer sheet. This time is much longer than the time 
  for one revolution.</P>

<P>&#9;You may assume that the frictional effects of the supports and air are negligible, and for the purposes of this question you should ignore self-inductance effects, although these would not be negligible.</P>
