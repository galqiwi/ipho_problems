<I>l</I> is the length of the free part of the bimorph. 
<P>
See Fig. 2. for x, y and D.
<P>
When the bimorph bends into an arc shape the mirror at the end
is rotated by an angle  /2. This results in a change of a direction
of the reflected beam by an angle . The spot formed by the reflected
beam on the screen moves by a distance y (see Fig. 2.). If the
angle between the reflected beam and the screen is  (&lt;90 degrees
to increase accuracy)  the small angle  by which the laser beam
is deflected due to the movement of the bimorph is given by  =
y sin/D = yx/D<SUP>2</SUP> (y&lt;&lt;D).
<P>
The angle of rotation of the mirror /2 is related to the deflection
d of the free end of the bimorph by d = l sin /4 (see Fig. 3).

<LI> Identify a quantity proportional to the energy dissipated
in the bimorph.
</OL>

<P>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
The force moving the bimorph is proportional to the applied voltage
V, the distance is proportional to the displacement d so the area
under the plot of d versus V is proportional to the energy. Therefore
the area inside the hysteresis curve is proportional to the energy
dissipated in the bimorph.

proportional to the energy dissipated in the bimorph.

One can conclude from this graph that the  displacement is not
proportional to the length. One can then plot log d versus log
<I>l </I>(see Graph 5) and calculate the slope which will give
the value of n. From Graph 5 we obtain n = 1.89 +- 0.13.  Notice

The 1G resistor and bimorph form an RC circuit. If we charge the
capacitance of the bimorph to maximum voltage (V<SUB>0 </SUB>=
36V) and disconnect the battery the voltage will decay according
to the formula V= V<SUB>0</SUB> exp(-t/RC)  where t is elapsed
time. If the voltmeter with the input resistance of 1M is connected
to the bimorph to measure the voltage directly, the time constant
is too short to be measured. The deflection of the bimorph is
proportional to the voltage so one can measure the decay time
indirectly by observing the decay of the deflection after the
bimorph was charged. To do so efficiently one can mark several
points on the screen between deflection corresponding to the maximum
voltage and 0 voltage and measure the time deflection decays to
these points. The slope of the plot of logarithm of deflection
versus time (Graph 6) or the equivalent calculations will give
time constant and knowing R one can obtain C.
